# Sample Backbone, Openlayers3 and Requirejs application

Sample Backbone.js application that uses OL3 loaded as an AMD module.


## View Application

To view the application in your browser:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/codrineugeniu/backbone-openlayers.git
   ```

1. Install dependencies:

   ```
   $ npm install
   ```

1. Point your browser to `localhost:3000`.

## Explanations

`file://` protocol is not supported by the CORS protocols, so we need to host the app.

Openlayers 3 is under active development, so stuff might break without notice.
